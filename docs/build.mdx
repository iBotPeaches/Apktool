# Build Apktool

Apktool is a project that contains a collection of subprojects and dependencies.

- **brut.apktool.lib** - Main Library
- **brut.apktool.cli** - CLI Interface
- **brut.j.dir** - Utility
- **brut.j.util** - Utility
- **brut.j.common** - Utility

### Requirements

- [JDK](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/) > 11
- [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- [Gradle](https://gradle.org/)

### Build Steps

First clone the repository using either:
[SSH](ssh://git@github.com:iBotPeaches/Apktool.git) or [HTTPS](https://github.com/iBotPeaches/Apktool.git).

1. Navigate to the Apktool folder and for the remaining steps use `./gradlew` for Unix based systems or `gradlew.bat` for Windows.
2. You can build the project in two ways:

:::info
v2.10 moved from Proguard to R8, but kept the naming to Proguard for the time being. This will be updated in the future.
:::

#### Without R8 (JDK > 8)

```bash
[./gradlew][gradlew.bat] build shadowJar
```

- Creating a jar file: `brut.apktool/apktool-cli/build/libs/apktool-cli-all.jar`.

#### With R8 (JDK > 11):

```bash
[./gradlew][gradlew.bat] build shadowJar proguard
```

- Creating a jar file: `brut.apktool/apktool-cli/build/libs/apktool-vXXX.jar`.

#### Windows Requirements

:::caution
Be aware of directory path length limitations on Windows.
:::

Windows has some limitations regarding max filepath. At one location in Apktool, we have a 218 character directory path
which means due to the limitation of max 255 characters on Windows we need to enforce some requirements.

This leaves 37 characters total to clone the project on Windows. For example, I can clone this project to the location

```text
C:/Users/Connor/Desktop/Apktool
```

This is 31 characters, which allows Apktool to be cloned properly. Cloning the project into a directory longer than 37
characters will not work.
