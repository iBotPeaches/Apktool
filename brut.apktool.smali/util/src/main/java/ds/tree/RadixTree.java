/**
 * This interface represent the operation of a radix tree. A radix tree,
 * Patricia trie/tree, or crit bit tree is a specialized set data structure
 * based on the trie that is used to store a set of strings. In contrast with a
 * regular trie, the edges of a Patricia trie are labelled with sequences of
 * characters rather than with single characters. These can be strings of
 * characters, bit strings such as integers or IP addresses, or generally
 * arbitrary sequences of objects in lexicographical order. Sometimes the names
 * radix tree and crit bit tree are only applied to trees storing integers and
 * Patricia trie is retained for more general inputs, but the structure works
 * the same way in all cases.
