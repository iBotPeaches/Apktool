## Known Issues

**Files in `_includes` have to be written with raw HTML**  
 - Not sure how to execute markdown via an include command. Doesn't work with versions of dependencies installed on Github pages
 
**Dates in `_data/releases.yml` have to include the timestamp like so `2010-03-02 00:00:0`**
 - I believe this is a YAML limitation, so make sure to always have a `00:00:0` timestamp added to days
 
**Links in `_data/releases.yml` have to be hardcoded to live site**
 - appending `/Apktool/` because `{{ site.github.url }}` doesn't work
