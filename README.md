It is a tool designed for reverse engineering 3rd party, closed, binary Android apps. This tool can decode resources to their original form and rebuild them after modifications. Additionally, it enables debugging smali code step by step and simplifies working with the app through a project-like file structure and automation of some repetitive tasks such as building apk.

It is important to note that this tool is not intended for piracy or other non-legal uses. Instead, it can be used for localization, adding features, or supporting custom platforms for good purposes. We encourage users to be fair with the authors of the app they use and appreciate.
